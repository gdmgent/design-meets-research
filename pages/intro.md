## Methodologie 
(nog te vertalen) The methodology used for this educational innovation and design project equals the methodology that we will implement in our curriculum.  

Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation. Once restricted to the designer's toolkit it has now become mainstream to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success. Design thinking is also a mindset and approach to learning, collaboration, and problem solving in the classroom. In practice, the design process is a structured framework for identifying challenges, gathering information, generating potential solutions, refining ideas, and testing solutions. Design thinking can be flexibly implemented; serving equally well as a framework for a course design, a roadmap for an activity or group project. 

## Mindsets

- **Everyone is creative!** Everyone can have big ideas an has the ability to act on them.​
- **Learn from the people** you’re designing for to come up with new ideas.​
- If you don’t know the answer to a problem, **go out and explore** and you’ll arrive at unexpected solutions.​
- Make your **ideas come to live**. Impactful solutions can’t stay in the realm of theory. Show, don’t tell!​
- **Failure is an experiment** through which you’re going to learn.​
- **Gain validation** along the way through feedback from the people you’re designing for.​
- **Progress is always an option!** Optimism is the thing that drives you forward.​
